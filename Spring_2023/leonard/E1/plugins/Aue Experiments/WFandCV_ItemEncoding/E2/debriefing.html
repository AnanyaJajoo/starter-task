            <p>Thank you for your participation.</p>

            <p>The memory test you just took is called recognition; recognition is when you have to decide whether an item or pair of items was experienced previously. It is a task that we use every day. For example, when you answer a multiple choice question on an exam you are performing recognition.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this research project is to understand how the characteristics of words influence recognition. We are trying to understand if performance differs for:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dd>Common versus uncommon words</dd>
                    <dd>Words experienced in a few sitations versus words experienced in a vairety of situations</dd>
                    <dd>Whether the above properties includen memory for individual itesm versus memory for whether or not items appeared together, also know as associative memory.</dd>
                </dl>
