        <div class="card-body">

            <p>The laboratory of Dr. Criss invites you to participate in a research study. Involvement in the study is voluntary,             so you may choose to participate or not. This sheet will explain the study to you and please feel free to ask questions about the research if you have any. I will be happy to explain anything in detail if you wish. The Criss lab is interested in learning more about human cognition and memory. You will be asked to participate in a series oftasks that involve making judgments about items. This will take no more than 60 minutes of your time. All information will be kept confidential. This means that your name will not appear anywhere. I will assign a number to your responses, and there will be no connection between your name and your responses. All members ofthe research team have access to the data. Other researchers may have access to data that is not individually identifiable per American Psychological Association guidelines. Your participation in this experiment will count toward PSY 205 research credits. You will receive 0.25 credit hours for every 15 minutes of the experiment. If you withdraw from the study after you begin, then you will receive 0.25 credit hours for
            every 15 minutes that you participated. The benefit ofthis research is that you will be helping us to understand cognition. There are no benefits to you by taking part. The risks to you of participating in this study are mild discomfort similar to what you might experience while taking a test or sitting in a lecture. These risks will be minimized by adjusting the chair, mouse, or taking a break when indicated on the computer monitor. If you do not want to take part, you have the right to refuse to take part, without penalty. If you decide to take part and later no longer wish to continue, you have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without penalty.</p>
